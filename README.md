# ASCII Art Generator

## Overview
This project is designed to convert photos into ASCII art, a graphical design technique that uses text characters to create images. The tool allows you to generate ASCII art from images and save the output as image and text files.

## Features
**. Photo to ASCII Conversion:** Convert any photo into a detailed ASCII art representation.

**. Multiple Output Formats:** Save the generated ASCII art as both an image file (e.g., PNG) and a text file.

**. Customizable Settings:** Adjust parameters such as character set, resolution, and contrast to fine-tune the ASCII art output.

## Installation

#  Usage
To generate ASCII art from an image, follow these steps:

**1. Place your image in the `input` folder.**

**2. Run the script:**
